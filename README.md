你好！
很冒昧用这样的方式来和你沟通，如有打扰请忽略我的提交哈。我是光年实验室（gnlab.com）的HR，在招Golang开发工程师，我们是一个技术型团队，技术氛围非常好。全职和兼职都可以，不过最好是全职，工作地点杭州。
我们公司是做流量增长的，Golang负责开发SAAS平台的应用，我们做的很多应用是全新的，工作非常有挑战也很有意思，是国内很多大厂的顾问。
如果有兴趣的话加我微信：13515810775  ，也可以访问 https://gnlab.com/，联系客服转发给HR。

## Dep

`dep` is a prototype dependency management tool for Go. It requires Go 1.8 or newer to compile. **`dep` is safe for production use.**

`dep` is the official _experiment_, but not yet the official tool. Check out the [Roadmap](https://github.com/golang/dep/wiki/Roadmap) for more on what this means!

For guides and reference materials about `dep`, see [the documentation](https://golang.github.io/dep).

## Installation

It is strongly recommended that you use a released version. Release binaries are available on the [releases](https://github.com/golang/dep/releases) page.

On MacOS you can install or upgrade to the latest released version with Homebrew:

```sh
$ brew install dep
$ brew upgrade dep
```

If you're interested in hacking on `dep`, you can install via `go get`:

```sh
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
```

## Feedback

Feedback is greatly appreciated.
At this stage, the maintainers are most interested in feedback centered on the user experience (UX) of the tool.
Do you have workflows that the tool supports well, or doesn't support at all?
Do any of the commands have surprising effects, output, or results?
Let us know by filing an issue, describing what you did or wanted to do, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened.

## Contributing

Contributions are greatly appreciated.
The maintainers actively manage the issues list, and try to highlight issues suitable for newcomers.
The project follows the typical GitHub pull request model.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
Before starting any work, please either comment on an existing issue, or file a new one.
